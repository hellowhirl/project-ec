# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

## My approach

I used React with TypeScript to demonstrate my familiarity with building a single page application that makes async API requests, renders response data, handles user interaction, and routes to different views depending on context.

The requirements didn’t mention or show anything about a layout for a tablet/pc view. I asked this in the Issues section of this project but did not receive a response. So I designed the application to be limited to mobile view.

## If I had more time

- Organize css code into component-scoped css modules
- More complete componentization
- More tests and linting
- Proper parsing of each item’s descriptions
- Fill heart icon with color on Single Item Display page after user clicks/unclicks it
- Add additional icons to match the UI
- Add すべて for categories and visually indicate which category has been selected
